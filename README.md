# esp8266-shockduino

ESP8266 to provide a webserver to control a shock collar

The core code to send to the collar is based on 
  https://github.com/smouldery/shock-collar-control/blob/master/Arduino%20Modules/transmitter_vars.ino

I've taken this and just kludged it, and then put an ESP8266 web interface
in front.

The NOTES file explains how the data needs to be sent.
